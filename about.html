        Hello! My name is Michelle Deng and I am currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University, obtaining my
        Master's in Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences. I am interested in using machine learning techniques
        to build technologies that will learn and adapt to people's learning styles in order to help teach them effectively
        and efficiently. In my free time, I love to practice yoga, read, exercise, listen to music, shoot photography, and draw.
